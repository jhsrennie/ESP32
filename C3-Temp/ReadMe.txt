C3-Temp
-------
Test of the temperature sensor built into the ESP32-C3.

There is nothing to configure. Just upload the sketch and it will print the temperature to the serial monitor.

Note that this won't work on the original ESP32 as it doesn't have a temperature sensor. I tested it on a C3 SuperMini board and it worked fine.
