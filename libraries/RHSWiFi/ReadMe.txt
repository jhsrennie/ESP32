RHSWifi
-------
This is my own version of a WiFi class for the ESP32.

This was written to see how the IDF functions work. There is no advantage over the built in WiFi class so I suspect this will only be of interest only if you are curious how the IDF wifi functions work.

See the TestRHSWifi sketch for how to use the class.
