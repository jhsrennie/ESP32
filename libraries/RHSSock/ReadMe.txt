RHSSock
-------
This is a port of a BSD sockets class that I wrote decades ago. I wrote it mostly to learn how to use sockets on the ESP32. I don't think it offers any significant advantage over the ESP32's built in networking classes.

I suspect this will only be of interest if you are curious how the IDF sockets functions work.

See the TestRHSSock sketch for how to use the class.
