SocketsAPI
----------
This uses the BSD sockets API to create a telnet server. Connect to it using whatever telnet client you prefer.

I wrote this to see how BSD sockets works on the ESP32. It doesn't do anything useful and won't be of interest unless you too are curious about BSD sockets.

You will need to edit the code to set your own wifi SSID and password.
