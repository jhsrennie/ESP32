### Display Pins

```
MISO      GPIO 12
MOSI      GPIO 13
SCKL      GPIO 14
CS        GPIO 15
DC        GPIO  2
Backlight GPIO 21
```

### Touchscreen Pins

```
IRQ       GPIO 36
MOSI      GPIO 32
MISO      GPIO 39
CLK       GPIO 25
CS        GPIO 33
```

### RGB LED

```
Red LED   GPIO 4
Green LED GPIO 16
Blue LED  GPIO 17
```

Important: The RGB LEDs work with inverted logic, because they are active low. This means that if you set them to HIGH = OFF and LOW = ON.

### MicroSD Card Pins

MISO      GPIO 19
MOSI      GPIO 23
SCK       GPIO 18
CS        GPIO 5

### Light Dependent Resistor

```
LDR       GPIO 34
```

### Connectors

In the P3 connector, you have a GND pin and GPIO 35, GPIO 22, and GPIO 21.

Please note that GPIO 22 is also used on the CN1 connector and that GPIO 21 is used as a backlight for the display. So, as long as the backlight is on, GPIO 21 will be on.

In the CN1 connector, you have GND, GPIO 22, GPIO 27 and 3V3 pins. Please note that GPIO22 is also available on the P3 connector.

### Speaker

There is a 2P 1.25mm JST connector to connect a speaker. It’s controlled with GPIO 26.
