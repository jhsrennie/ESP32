### TFT_eSPI

This is the Adafruit library example from the [ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display repository](https://github.com/witnessmenow/ESP32-Cheap-Yellow-Display) on GitHub rewritten to use the TFT_eSPI library. To compile this you need to install the TFT_eSPI by Bodmer library.

After installing the TFT_eSPI library you need to edit the User_Setup.h file to configure the library for the CYD. You can get this from the [Random Nerd Tutorials site](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/lvgl-cheap-yellow-display-esp32-2432s028r/) or I have included it in the directory above this. Copy the file into your `libraries\TFT_eSPI` directory and replace the file that is already there.

If, like me, you can never remember all the drawing functions this is a very useful reference as it uses all the common functions.
