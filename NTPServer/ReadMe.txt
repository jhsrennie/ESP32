NTPServer
---------
This extends the NTPClient sketch to add an NTP server as well.

I found it wasn't a very good NTP server as the reply transmitted from the ESP32 frequently wasn't received, but it's an interesting proof of principle.

The NTP server code comes from Andreas Spiess's YouTube video:
