# ESP32

This is a collection of ESP32 sketches that I written. Mostly they were just written for fun rather than to actually be useful. However they show how to code lots of useful features.

They were all written on a WROOM but they should run on most ESP32s. Note however that some, like the C3, do not have a DAC built in so the sketches that use DACs won't work. All code uses the Arduino interface not the IDF.

ADC-DMA  
Code to test continuous A to D input. Also demonstrates use of the cosine generator.

C3-Temp  
Demonstrate use of the C3 on chip temperature sensor

Cosgen  
experiment with cosine generator.
