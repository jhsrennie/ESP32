WaveGen
-------
This uses continuous DAC to output various waveforms on both DAC pins 25 and 26.

The code was written to learn how to use continuous DAC so it isn't very useful on its own. Once I had got it working I used the code in my fully featured ESPWaveGen sketch, so look at that instead if you want code that's actually useful.
