This sketch demonstrates how to set the wireless interface to promiscuous mode so it sniffs all network traffic.

The sketch doesn't do anything especially useful - it just prints a list of the MAC addresses it has detected to the serial monitor. It's intended to show the principles and functions and structures required in case you want to do anythong more complicated.
