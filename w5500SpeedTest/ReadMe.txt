W5500 speed test
----------------
This is a sketch to test the W5500 ethernet module. It also demonstrates how to run a web server on the W5500.

The sketch configures the W5500 as a DHCP client then runs a web server. Opening the IP address of the W5500 in a browser will send back a file of random data and time how long it takes to measure the speed. If you're just interested in how to get the W5500 to work you can ignore the speed test code.
