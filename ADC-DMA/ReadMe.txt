ADC-DMA
-------
This was written to learn how to code the continuous ADC mode.

The sketch uses the cosine generator to create a 200Hz signl on pin 25 then it uses continuous ADC to read the signal through pin 36. To use it just connect pins 25 and 36 together.

The sketch reads 2K data points and writes them to the serial monitor, then stops. So it isn't useful for anything except learning how to code the features used.
