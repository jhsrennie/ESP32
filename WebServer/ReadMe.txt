WebServer
---------
This sketch creates a basic HTTP server. Connect to its IP address and you'll get a simple home page. You can use links on the home page to turn the on board LED on and off, and there is a simple form to show how form input is handled.

You will need to edit the code to enter your own wifi SSIS and password. The IP address that the ESP32 gets is printed to the serial monitor so you can see what it is.
