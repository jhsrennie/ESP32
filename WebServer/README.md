WebServer
=========
This shows how to set up an HTTP server.

The Arduino example shows how to use the Arduino WebServer class while the IDF directory shows how to use the ESP-IDF functions. The ESP-IDF functions have les overhead but they are more work.

The server doesn't do anything interesting. It is intended as boilerplate code for you to drop into your sketch and adapt to your own requirements.
