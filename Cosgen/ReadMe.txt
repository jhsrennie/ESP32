CosGen
------
This was written to learn how to code the cosine generator.

The sketch uses the cosine generator to create a signal on DAC channel 1, which is pin 25 on a WROOM. Connect your iscilloscope to pin 25 to test it.

The sketch reads a frequency from the serial monitor so you can type the frequency you want into the serial link.
